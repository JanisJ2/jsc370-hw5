## Data Collection

The data was retrieved from the TMDb API using the `/discover/movie`, `/movie/{id}`, and `/movie/{id}/credits` endpoints. This allowed access to detailed movie-level metadata and cast/crew popularity.

## Data Cleaning

- Removed movies with zero or missing revenue, budget, or runtime
- One-hot encoded genres and labeled seasons based on release month
- Converted revenue and budget to $\log_{10}$ scale for analysis

## Feature Engineering

- Created average actor and crew popularity scores
- Derived `season` and `release_year` from `release_date`
- Included genre binary indicators and runtime

## Statistical Tools

- Linear and multiple regression
- ANOVA to test for seasonal effects
- Interactive plots using `plotly` to explore relationships and trends
