## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the JSC370 instructors for providing clear structure and lab-based guidance. Lab 11 and Lab 12 examples were particularly helpful when designing the layout and interactive elements.

## Additional Notes

This project focuses only on top-revenue movies, which may introduce survivorship bias. Future work could compare this dataset to low- and mid-tier revenue films to identify differences more broadly.
